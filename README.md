# School SMP Rules
## General rules (apply everywhere)
- No building within 100 blocks of spawn
- No glitches or machines that impact server performance eg. lag machines
- No duplication, commands, teleportation glitches, cheats, hacks or x-ray
- No spawn killing (that's just rude)
- **Be nice**. Try to limit racism and NO NSFW.

**I understand that serious problems may be reported to schools and/or police.**
## Server 1 Rules
- No crystals or anchors(it's just no fun)
- You cant kill people if they have iron or no armour unless:
- They fight you first
- OR grief your property
- OR they have above iron armour but are intentionally not using it
- If you start fighting someone you cannot log out until 30 seconds after the last hit.

## Server 2 Rules (currently inactive)
