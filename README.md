# School SMP Rules & Info
These rules may be updated along the course of the server without you being notified. Even if you are not aware of the new rules, they will still apply and you will still face the consequences of not following them.

## General rules (apply in MC and Discord)
- Things you say or create on the server must not show hate or extreme bias or encourage illegal activity. **This will result in an instant ban**
- **Be nice**. NO RACISM, NSFW, TERRORIST/EXTREMIST CONTENT, BULLYING/HARASSMENT OR THREATS. **This will result in an instant ban**

**Please understand that serious problems may be reported to police.**
## MC Rules
- No joining with hacked or unofficial clients. You need a paid minecraft account to play.
  - Modded clients are ok so long as they:
    - Do not include mods which give you an unfair advantage
    - Do not include resource packs which give you an unfair advantage
    - Do not modify how your client sends/recives messages to and from the server
    - If you are unsure whether a mod or resource pack does any of the above, just ask.
- No crystals, anchors or using beds to explode others. (it's just no fun) **This will result in an instant ban**
- Players that are in peaceful teams cannot take damage from other players and cannot damage other players. This is enforced by the School SMP Plugin. Finding a loophole and exploiting it **will result in an instant ban**
- If you start fighting someone you cannot log out until 30 seconds after the last hit.
- Don't try to find technicalties in the rules *"oh it wasn't me using a crystal because I only placed it down and a skeleton shot it"*. We're not stupid, and we don't care. You will be banned
- No selling in-game items or services for real-world money or in exchange for real world property
- No building within 100 blocks of spawn
- No glitches or machines that impact server performance eg. lag machines
- No duplication, teleporation or otherwise exploiting glitches, command/admin abuse, cheats, hacks or x-ray. **This will result in an instant ban**
- No spawn killing (that's just rude)

## Custom plugins and features
There are many plugins to ensure the server runs smoothly. They are only server-side which means you cannot and do not need to install them yourself, you can join with a normal minecraft client and they will still work.

## School SMP Plugin
The School SMP Plugin has been developed specificly for use in this server. Its features are:
### Peaceful teams
The School SMP Plugin works with Better Teams and gives players an option to make their team peaceful. Players in peaceful teams:
- cannot melee damage other players (eg. swords, axes)
- cannot ranged damage other players (eg. bows, tridents)
- cannot explode other players (eg. TNT, tricking creepers)

Players in peaceful teams can also not be damaged by these methods from other players.

The team owner has the permission to change the peaceful-ness status of the team with `/setteampeaceful <true/false>`. This can only be changed once per week, so a PvP team cannot switch to peaceful mode when they are being attacked and vise-versa. If a team is found to be strategically switching between peaceful and PvP, they will be permanently locked in one or the other.

You can check the peacefulness status of your team with `/isteampeaceful`. You can also check the peacefulness status of another team with `/isteampeaceful "TeamName"`.

**NOTE:** peaceful players are not actually in peaceful mode: ie. they still take damage from mobs, fall damage and hunger.

**NOTE 2:** the School SMP Plugin may have bugs/exploits. These should be reported to @GoogleCoder if discovered, possibly in exchange for a reward. Exploiting these bugs **will result in an instant ban**

### More features to come in the future
