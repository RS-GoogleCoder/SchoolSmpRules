# School SMP Rules
These rules may be updated along the course of the server without you being notified. Even if you are not aware of the new rules, they will still apply and you will still face the consequences of not following them.

## General rules (apply in MC and Discord)
- Things you say or create on the server must not show hate or extreme bias or encourage illegal activity. **This will result in an instant ban**
- **Be nice**. NO RACISM, NSFW, TERRORIST/EXTREMIST CONTENT, BULLYING/HARASSMENT OR THREATS. **This will result in an instant ban**

**I understand that serious problems may be reported to schools and/or police.**
## MC Rules
- No joining with hacked or unofficial clients. You need a paid minecraft account to play.
  - Modded clients are ok so long as they:
    - Do not include mods which give you an unfair advantage
    - Do not include resource packs which give you an unfair advantage
    - Do not modify how your client sends/recives messages to and from the server
    - If you are unsure whether a mod or resource pack does any of the above, just ask.
- No crystals or anchors (it's just no fun) **This will result in an instant ban**
- You can't kill people if they have iron or no armour unless:
  - They fight you first
  - OR grief your property
  - OR you have seen that they have above iron armour but are intentionally not using it to avoid fighting. If you are unsure, it's better to not fight and not risk a ban
- If you start fighting someone you cannot log out until 30 seconds after the last hit.
- Don't try to find technicalties in the rules *"oh it wasn't me using a crystal because I only placed it down and a skeleton shot it"*. We're not stupid, and we don't care. You will be banned
- No selling in-game items or services for real-world money or in exchange for real world property
- No building within 100 blocks of spawn
- No glitches or machines that impact server performance eg. lag machines
- No duplication, teleporation or otherwise exploiting glitches, command/admin abuse, cheats, hacks or x-ray. **This will result in an instant ban**
- No spawn killing (that's just rude)
